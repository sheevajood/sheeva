Implementing Secret function.
Overview
Users should be able to send a number to a Secret function to determines if the Secret function in back-end is additive. If the functions is additive it should return a message to the user that indicates that the function is additive. The additive function is the one that the result of secret(X+Y) is the same as secret(X + Y).

Requirements
An entry page for the user to enter an integer value.
Number should be greater than 1.
A result page to inform user if the function is additive or not.

________________________________________

Validation
Popup message if the user enters an invalid integer or if the integer is less than 2.
Message: “Please enter a valid number greater than 1”

Design Pattern
Use an interface class for the secret method and concert and factory class to get the right class and secret method. This way it gives us a framework to be able to add more secret functions on different scenarios.
 

________________________________________

Classes
1)	SecretInterface Interface: that contains the secret method (Return type: int, Paramters: int)
2)	SecretConcrete class: Create an implementation of the secret method by implementing the SecretInterface interface.
3)	SecretFactory class: Get an instance of the concrete class.
4)	SecretManager: Centralize all the methods that can be used in this programs and test them. Methods: public List<Integers> getPrimeNumber(int), Private Boolean isPrime(int)
5)	 Secret servlet: contains doGet() method to get the request and return the response.

Flow








1)	Secret.jsp sends a request to the Secret servlet class and passes the user entry (number)
2)	Secret class calls the SecretFactory to gets the SecretInterface 
3)	Secret class calls the SecretMenage to gets all the prime numbers for the integer that user enters and then calls the secret(int) method to find out if it is additive or not
4)	Secret class then forward the message to another jsp file, secretResults.jsp
